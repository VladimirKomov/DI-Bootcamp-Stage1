        <h5>Early Life and Background (1937-1956)</h5>
        <p>
          George Denis Patrick Carlin was born on May 12, 1937, in Manhattan,
          New York City. Raised primarily by his mother after his parents
          separated, Carlin attended various Catholic schools before dropping
          out at age 15. In 1954, he enlisted in the United States Air Force,
          where he began working as a disc jockey at KJOE, a local radio
          station.

        <p class="author">-- George Carlin</p>

        <h5>Early Career (1956-1960)</h5>
        <p>
          After being discharged from the Air Force, Carlin pursued a career in
          broadcasting and comedy. He formed a comedy duo with Jack Burns,
          performing in clubs and on the radio. Their partnership ended in 1962,
          leading Carlin to start his solo career.

        <p class="author">-- George Carlin</p>

        <h5>Rise to Fame (1960s)</h5>
        <p>
          In the 1960s, Carlin became a frequent performer on television shows
          like "The Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson. Initially known for his
          clean-cut image and conventional routines, he transformed his style by
          the late 1960s, adopting a countercultural tone and addressing
          controversial social issues.

        </blockquote>
        <p class="author">-- George Carlin</p>

        <h5>Breakthrough and Controversy (1970s)</h5>
        <p>
          The 1970s were pivotal for Carlin. His 1972 album "Class Clown"
          featured the "Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television" routine,
          leading to his arrest for obscenity and a landmark Supreme Court case,
          FCC v. Pacifica Foundation. This decade saw him release successful
          albums and make regular TV appearances, cementing his status as a
          provocative comedian.

          <q>Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.</q>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="author">-- George Carlin</p>

        <h5>Continued Success and Evolution (1980s-1990s)</h5>
        <p>
          Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Carlin adapted his material to reflect
          societal changes, continuing his critique of American culture. His HBO
          specials, starting with "George Carlin at USC" (1977), showcased his
          evolving thoughts. Carlin also acted in films like "Bill & Ted's
          Excellent Adventure" (1989) and narrated "Thomas & Friends" in the
          U.S. He authored best-selling books, including "Brain Droppings"
          (1997).

        <p class="author">-- George Carlin</p>

        <h5>Later Years and Legacy (2000s)</h5>
        <p>
          In the 2000s, Carlin continued to tour and produce new material. His
          later HBO specials, such as "You Are All Diseased" (1999), explored
          darker themes. He received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in
          2008 but passed away on June 22, 2008, at age 71 due to heart failure.

        <h5>Legacy</h5>
        <p>

          social criticism, challenging taboo topics and influencing future
          comedians. His sharp observations and linguistic creativity left a
          lasting legacy, celebrated for its enduring relevance and insight into

                When George Carlin is asked which HBO concert is his favorite,
                his answer is always, "Jammin' In New York." The reasons are
                several: It was his first HBO show done live; it was the first
                he had done in his hometown, New York City; and it was the
                largest audience he had ever worked before: 6,500.
